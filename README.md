# ML-Pipelines-on-Google-Cloud

In this project, I will learn about TensorFlow Extended (or TFX), 
which is Googleâ€™s production machine learning platform based on TensorFlow for management of ML pipelines and metadata.

I learn learn about pipeline components and pipeline orchestration with TFX.

I also learn how you can automate your pipeline through continuous integration and continuous deployment, and how to manage ML metadata.

I reuse ML pipelines across multiple ML frameworks such as tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, and xgboost.  
I also learn how to use another tool on Google Cloud, Cloud Composer, to orchestrate your continuous training pipelines. 
And finally, i go over how to use MLflow for managing the complete machine learning life cycle.
